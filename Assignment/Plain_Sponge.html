    <h1>Method</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4, butter and line the base of two 20cm
        spring-form cake tins with baking parchment.</l1>
      <li>
        Using an electric whisk beat the butter and sugar together until pale
        and fluffy. Crack the eggs in one at a time and whisk well, scraping
        down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Add the lemon zest,
        vanilla, flour, milk and a pinch of salt. Whisk until just combined then
        divide the mixture between the two tins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the centre of the oven for 25-30 mins until a skewer inserted
        into the middle of each cake comes out clean. After 10 mins remove the
        cakes from their tins and leave to cool completely on a wire rack. Fill
        how you like. My personal favourite is a good dollop of lemon curd and
        some fresh cream, then dust the top with icing sugar. Will keep for 3
        days.
